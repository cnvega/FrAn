DEPENDENCES
  This software is written in Python, and requires the following modules:
    - PIL, the Python Image Library to do all the image operations.
    - Pyx, to create the plots in PostScript format.


LIMITATIONS
  This software only can process RGB images in which each color channel 
  can be transformed to a 0-255 integer value. A conversion to greyscale
  is necessary to apply the box counting method, and to do this the PIL
  algorithms are applied. 


TODO
  - Improve the computing time.
  - Add compatibility to FITS images (having counts in pixels instead 
    of colors)
  - Change PYX plots to matplotlib
  - Add multithreading support and/or MPI.
